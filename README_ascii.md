# ASCII art generators

There are currently three ASCII generators, one for color images, and two for black and white images, one light and one dark.
* FIXME: the images dictionary must be edited manually to incorporate new images.
** NOTE:To edit the size of the printed image, raise or lower the number `image.height` (line 45) is being divided by. ***
To use the scripts, run them and enter the image you want to convert.
`ascii_art.py` and `ascii_art_bl_wh.py` use only unicode characters.
