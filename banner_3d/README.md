# Banner 3D module

Banner 3D is a simple module that allows the user to convert regular text to special 'banner 3D' text.

The text can have a different background and foreground color.

NOTE: the converted text may be to big for your screen, if so, zoom out in the terminal. 

also, the module currently does NOT support numbers.
